# Determinant 
Determinant are the Scalar values that can be computed from the elements of square matrix.
They describe how much a Sampled Area in the Vector Space Changes in scale with Linear Transformations.
This tells whether the transformations are linearly dependent or not.

# Linear Transformations
Linear Transformations are the ways of changing the vector by ## Stretching, ## Squeezing, ## rotating, or ## flipping but always in a straight line.
It must not be bend from any point
we represent a vector as
^   ^
i , j Read it as i(cap), j(cap)

3 units right(x direction) and 2 units up(y direction) 
vector v = 3i(cap) + 2j(cap) 

Example of ### Determinants = 

c = |1 2 3|
    |3 2 1|
    |1 3 2|
determinant of C is = 
[1((2*2)-(3*1))] - [2((3*2)-(1*1))] + [(3(3*3)-(2*1))]
[1(4-3)] - [2(6-1)]+ [3(9-2)]
[1*1]-[2*5]+[3*7]
[1]-[10]+[21]
12
determinant of C or |C|= 12
