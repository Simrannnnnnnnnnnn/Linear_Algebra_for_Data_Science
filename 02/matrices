# Matrix  
**Matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. 
## Element - The individual number in a ### matric is called ###Elements.

## Matrix Notation
The element at the ùëñth row and ùëóth column of a matrix A is denoted as aij.
Example : if A=[1,2,3,4] then a(1,4) having 1 row and 4 columns. so number of elements = 1*4= 4

## Matrix Dimensions
A matrix is described by its dimensions  m X n, where 
m = number of rows 
n = number of columns

## Types of Matrices 
1. Row Matrix 
A matrix with only one row 
B = [1,2,3,4].

2. Column Matrix
A matrix with only one column.
c = | 1 |
    | 2 |
    | 3 |

3. Square Matrix
A matrix with an equal number of rows and columns
D = | 1 2 3 |
    | 4 5 6 |
    | 7 8 9 |

4. Diagonal Matrix 
A sqaure Matrix where all elements are 0 except those on the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom right)
E = |4 0 0|
    |0 5 0|
    |0 0 6|

5. Sparse Matrix 
A Matrix that are mostly 0 and have few non - zero elements 
F= |0 0 0|
   |0 0 2|

6. Identity Matrix 
A Diagonal Matrix with all the diagonal elements 1
G = |1 0 0|
    |0 1 0|
    |0 0 1|

7. Zero Matrix 
A Matrix where all the elements are zero it is also known as Null Matrix
H =|0 0 0|
   |0 0 0|
   |0 0 0|

8.Symmetric Matrix 
A square matrix equal to its Transpose 
I = |1 2 3|    I(Transpose)= |1 2 3|
    |2 4 5|                  |2 4 5|     
    |3 5 6|                  |3 5 6|

9.Skew Symmetric Matrix 
A sqaure Matrix that is equal to the negative of its transpose 
J= |0 -2 -3|  J(Transpose) = | 0  2  3|
   |2  0 -5|                 |-2  0  5|
   |3  5  0|                 |-3 -5  0|
