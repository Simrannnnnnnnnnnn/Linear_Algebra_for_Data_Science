# What is a Vector?
A # Vector is a mathematical object that has both magnitude(size) and direction
they represent a variety of entities such as a point in a multidimensional spae 

# Mathematical Representation 
- Vector in 2D Space 
v=[v1
   v2]  where, v1 and v2 are its components.
- Vector in 3D space 
v=[v1
   v2
   v3] where v1,v2 and v3 are its components.

# Opeartions on Vectors
vectors named u and v having components u1,u2 and v1,v2 respectively.

## 1. Addition

Addition of vector u and v is 

u + v = [u1   [v1    [u1 + v1
         u2] + v2] =  u2 + v2]

## 2. Subtraction

Subtraction of vector u and v is 
u - v = [u1   [v1    [u1 - v1
         u2] - v2] =  u2 - v2]

## 3. Scalar Multiplication

Scalar (single numerical value that represents magnitude but has no direction) 
The scalar multiplication of scalar(c) and vector[v1 , v2] is 
c . v = c. [v1    [ c . v1
            v2] =   c . v2]   scalar multiplication is used to measure similarity between vectors (cosine similarity)

# 4. Dot Product or Scalar product

The dot product of two vectors is
u . v = u1v1 + u2v2  this is used to measure similarity between vectors 

# 5. Norm (Magnitude) 

The length(Magnitude) of a vector v is 

||v|| = âˆšv1^2 + v2^2

# 6. Cross Product (3D vectors)
        | i  j  k |
u x v = | u1 u2 u3|
        | v1 v2 v3| this produces a vector Orthogonal to u and v.
